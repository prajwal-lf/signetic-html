                                <p>A client calls a commercial electrician to inspect a building. Using a dedicated custom app, a company representative schedules a field service employee to visit the client at their location during a designated call. The field service employee gets notified of the job through their own dedicated app which includes details of the appointment, the customer, the issue to be solved, and available schematics of the property. The field worker logs their arrival, takes notes during repair, logs repair details, originates a service bill, and logs their departure. The company uses this data for future maintenance as well as tracks performance of the team to identify improvements leading to more efficient response times, methods of resolution, and identify opportunities for added services. </p>
