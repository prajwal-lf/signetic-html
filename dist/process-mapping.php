                        <p>Signetic understands companies through their processes. To get you to where you want to go, we want to understand where you are. We do this by applying Process Mapping Methodology-- Signetic’s own framework that evolved over a decade of business application development.</p>

                        <p>Processes are made up of company goals, the steps used to deliver on those goals, the people that move steps forward, and the tools those people use.</p>

                        <p>Signetic’s Process Mapping is a proven method of understanding processes by detailing the interaction of goals, steps, people, and tools. The result is a detailed deliverable that acts as the single source of truth we use when designing your Digital Transformation.</p>
                        <p>Process mapping is conducted through free-flowing, one-on-one interviews with key players during a dedicated phase at the beginning of an engagement. Goals are gathered through leadership and stakeholder interviews. Steps and tools are mapped by interviewing team members involved in every step.</p>
